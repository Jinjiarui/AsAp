## Awesome Structure Awesome Pattern (AsAp)  [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)]

A toolkit to mine Awesome Pattern from Awesome Strcuture. Upon some widely adopted structured-based recommendation methods, we propose a series of plug-in modules: (i) AngelRec: enhancing the recommendation performance by pre-defined logics (so called metapath), (ii) HingeRec: enhancing the recommendation performance by interaction modules (especially convolution operations), (iii) StaRec: enhancing the recommendation performance by searching and retrieving relevant data, (iv) LabelRec: enhancing the recommendation performance by parallel use of features and labels.
